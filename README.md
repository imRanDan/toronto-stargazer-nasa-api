# Toronto Stargazers, a NASA API based web app
A frontend project that uses fetch to grab one of many of NASA's API's to see what the night sky looked like on a certain date.

**Link to project:** https://imrandan.github.io/toronto-stargazer-nasa-api/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML - CSS - JavaScript - APIs 

I started with browsing NASA's public APIs and picked out their APOD one. I then used fetch to grab the API and read their documentation to figure out how to get specifics such as the data of certain photos and a description that explains the context of each photo / video.

## Optimizations

I would add more styling options and perhaps more features that come with the APIs documentation.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned more about APIs and how to implement them in your web apps to integrate seamlessly with the goal that the user wants.
